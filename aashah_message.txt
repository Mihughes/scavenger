Hey, aashah - 
I forgot this was a two person assignment, and I don't have your correct email. I thought it might be aashah, but my email to that address was returned.
If you can read this then you obviously got in. There is a file in this repository named GIT_Exercises.docx that has the questions that we are supposed to answer, plus a few of my answers.

If you got in, post an message.
